# Window definitions

# Relative windows need an event to calculate the window relative to:
#   vehicle_id:     ID of an onther vehicle contained in other_vehicle_data
#   event_location: Absolute location of an event or object (in ft)
#   event_time:     Absolute time of an event

# Window lengths can be defined by:
#   time_range_s:   A time range in seconds
#   dist_range_ft:  A distance range in ft
# A single value will be treated as a symetrical window around the event
# Two values will be treated as the start and end points of the window relative to the event 
# In the latter case, a Negative value indicates pre-event distance/time,
# and a positive event indicates post-event distance/time.

# If no event is given then the window is treated as absolute, and two positive values
# (representing absolute start/stop distance/time) are expected.
